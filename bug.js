This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This commonly happens when you try to render a component that depends on state before the component has mounted or when using asynchronous operations to update state.

```javascript
// Incorrect - accessing count before it's initialized
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text> {/* Error may happen here */}      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
